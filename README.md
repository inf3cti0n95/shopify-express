# shopify-express

A small set of abstractions that will help you quickly build an Express.js app that consumes the Shopify API.

:exclamation: **This project is currently in alpha status**. This means that the API could change at any time. It also means that your feedback will have a big impact on how the project evolves, so please feel free to [open issues](https://github.com/shopify/shopify-express/issues) if there is something you would like to see added.


## Example

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const shopifyExpress = require('@shopify/shopify-express');

const app = express();

const {
  SHOPIFY_APP_KEY,
  SHOPIFY_APP_HOST,
  SHOPIFY_APP_SECRET,
  NODE_ENV,
} = process.env;

const shopify = shopifyExpress({
  host: SHOPIFY_APP_HOST,
  apiKey: SHOPIFY_APP_KEY,
  secret: SHOPIFY_APP_SECRET,
  scope: ['write_orders, write_products'],
  afterAuth(request, response) {
    const { session: { accessToken, shop } } = request;
    // install webhooks or hook into your own app here
    return response.redirect('/');
  },
});

// mounts '/auth/shopify' and '/api' off of '/'
app.use('/', shopify.routes);
```

## Shopify routes

```javascript
  const {routes} = shopifyExpress(config);
  app.use('/', routes);
```

Provides mountable routes for authentication and API proxying. The authentication endpoint also handles shop session storage using a configurable storage strategy (defaults to SQLite).

### `/auth/shopify`

Serves a login endpoint so merchants can access your app with a shop session.

### `/api`

Proxies requests to the api for the currently logged in shop. Useful to securely use api
endpoints from a client application without having to worry about CORS.

## shopStore

`shopifyExpress`'s config takes an optional `shopStore` key, You can use this to define a strategy for how the module will store your persistent data for user sessions.

### Strategies

By default the package comes with `MemoryStrategy`, `RedisStrategy`, and `SQLStrategy`. If none are specified, the default is `MemoryStrategy`.

#### MemoryStrategy

Simple javascript object based memory store for development purposes. Do not use this in production!

```javascript
const shopifyExpress = require('@shopify/shopify-express');
const {MemoryStrategy} = require('@shopify/shopify-express/strategies');

const shopify = shopifyExpress({
  shopStore: new MemoryStrategy(redisConfig),
  ...restOfConfig,
});
```

#### RedisStrategy

Uses [redis](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redis) under the hood, so you can pass it any configuration that's valid for the library.

```javascript
const shopifyExpress = require('@shopify/shopify-express');
const {RedisStrategy} = require('@shopify/shopify-express/strategies');

const redisConfig = {
  // your config here
};

const shopify = shopifyExpress({
  shopStore: new RedisStrategy(redisConfig),
  ...restOfConfig,
});
```

#### SQLStrategy

Uses [knex](https://www.npmjs.com/package/knex) under the hood, so you can pass it any configuration that's valid for the library. By default it uses `sqlite3` so you'll need to run `yarn add sqlite3` to use it. Knex also supports `postgreSQL` and `mySQL`.

```javascript
const shopifyExpress = require('@shopify/shopify-express');
const {SQLStrategy} = require('@shopify/shopify-express/strategies');

// uses sqlite3 if no settings are specified
const knexConfig = {
  // your config here
};

const shopify = shopifyExpress({
  shopStore: new SQLStrategy(knexConfig),
  ...restOfConfig,
});
```

SQLStrategy expects a table named `shops` with a primary key `id`, and `string` fields for `shopify_domain` and `access_token`. It's recommended you index `shopify_domain` since it is used to look up tokens.

If you do not have a table already created for your store, you can generate one with `new SQLStrategy(myConfig).initialize()`. This returns a promise so you can finish setting up your app after it if you like, but we suggest you make a separate db initialization script, or keep track of your schema yourself.

#### Custom Strategy

`shopifyExpress` accepts any javascript class matching the following interface:

```javascript
  class Strategy {
    // shop refers to the shop's domain name
    getShop({ shop }, done))
    // shop refers to the shop's domain name
    // data can by any serializable object
    storeShop({ shop, accessToken, data }, done)
  }
```

## Helper middleware

`const {middleware: {withShop, withWebhook}} = shopifyExpress(config);`

### `withShop`

`app.use('/someProtectedPath', withShop, someHandler);`

Express middleware that validates the presence of your shop session.

### `withWebhook`

`app.use('/someProtectedPath', withWebhook, someHandler);`

Express middleware that validates the presence of a valid HMAC signature to allow webhook requests from shopify to your app.

## Example app

You can look at [shopify-node-app](https://github.com/shopify/shopify-node-app) for a complete working example.
